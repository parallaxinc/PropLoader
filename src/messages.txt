This is a list of messages generated by PropLoader.  There are two command line options that affect the message output; -c and -v (code and verbose, respectively).
By default (ie: when no -c or -v option is active) a limited set of messages appears and contain just the text of the message.

With -c, a numeric code is prepended to each message in the format ###-<text_message>.
With -v, verbose (debugging) messages appear along with normal messages.  These are messages meant only for PropLoader developers to diagnose problems.
Both -c and -v can be used individually or together.

There are three categories of messages and message codes:

  * Status - These express state/progress/event information and are given codes 001 through 099.

  * Error - These express fatal problems and are given codes 100 and beyond.

  * Verbose - These are for seasoned developers. They may express state information or specific deep error information that is usually only helpful to a small
    set of users, thus, they are never shown without an active -v option on the command line. These are all automatically given the code 000; tools that parse
    them should ignore all 000-coded messages.

Code numbers ARE NEVER REUSED for a condition that means something different than what was first intended by a message.  When a new State or Error message
is created, it simply takes on the next available code number even if it's logically related to another far away message.

STATE MESSAGES

"002-Downloading to Propeller\n"
"003-Verifying RAM"

"007-Writing %s to the SD card", file
"008-%ld bytes remaining"
"009-%ld bytes sent"
"010-Setting module name to %s", name

ERROR MESSAGES
"100-Option -n can only be used to name wifi modules\n"
"101-Invalid address: %s\n", ip_address
"102-Download failed: %d\n", sts
"103-Can't open file '%s'\n", file
"104-Propeller not found on port %s\n", port_or_ip_address
"105-Failed to enter terminal mode\n"
"106-Unrecognized wi-fi module firmware\n"
"  Version is %s but expected %s.x...\n", wifiConnection->version(), WIFI_REQUIRED_MAJOR_VERSION
"  Recommended action: update firmware and/or PropLoader to latest version(s)."

"108-Invalid module name\n"
"109-Failed to set module name\n"



USE-CASE ORGANIZED MESSAGE EXAMPLES
The list below contains State, Error, and Verbose messages arranged by use-case so context is more obvious.  It does not necessarily contains every possible
message.  Those with an "X" in the -v column only appear when the -v (verbose) option is used.
